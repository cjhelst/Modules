I define technical writing as any type of writing that is meant to record something or help spread information.

This is my first time doing any kind of technical work or coding, so naturally this was a bit confusing. I had to refer to instructions several times to figure out what I was supposed to do, and the terminology of the website is still a little confusing to me. Still, I think this 'brute force' approach to learning can be helpful, as it forces me to figure everything out on my own, which facilitates more in-depth learning.
